# The IBM Architecture Advantage

This is the official repository for IBM Architecture Advantage content and materials.

## Using the diagrams

Diagrams are in either [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com), or Microsoft PowerPoint format. Where both formats are available the draw.io version is the authoritative source as these will always comply with the [IBM Carbon Design System](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/resources/) standards for diagrams and IBM icons. 


### PowerPoint

The majority of diagrams use a layered build approach that mimics how they would be drawn in a whiteboard presentation. Build the PowerPoint diagrams when presenting by repeatedly pressing the space bar while in presentation mode.

### draw.io

It is strongly recommended you download the [draw.io desktop application](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/latest) for your operating system. The web application can be used in a pinch for presentations but it doesn't work as well for editing.

#### Icons

Users who are looking to present the diagrams 'as is' can do so using any of the draw.io web application, or native desktop applications. If you are looking to modify the diagrams it is highly recommended you install the [IBM Cloud stencils for draw.io](https://github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/ibm-cloud-stencils) by following the directions provided in the linked repository.

Many of the IBM Cloud icons have been repurposed for the Architecture Advantage diagrams. Please maintain these in your modifications so consumers of your diagrams can easily 'map' between your versions and the versions published on [ibm.com/architectures](https://www.ibm.com/architectures) and other public sources.

#### Presentation

draw.io diagrams use draw's Layers feature which enables presenters to selectively reveal portions of the diagram. Like the PowerPoint diagrams, draw.io diagrams are layered to mimic how they are built in a whiteboard presentation.

 The Layers control is found by selecting "View -> Layers" in the draw.io menu bar. Layers are hidden / revealed by selecting the 'eye' icon next to the layer name in the Layers panel.

If you wish to add elements to the diagram:
- first reveal all of the layers ('open' the eye icon next to each layer name in the Layers panel); then 
- add all of your elements (it's generally easier to work on the final version of the diagram and then break it into layers); and then
- add the elements to the layers byselecting the elements (boxes, lines, text, etc.) and adding them to the desired layer by clicking on the "Move selection to..." option (the stacked square icon) at the bottom of the Layers panel.

Elements can be deleted from the diagrams by simply selecting them and hitting the Delete key, or by selecting the "Delete" option on the right-click menu.
